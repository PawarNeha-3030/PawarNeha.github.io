# Button Order Change Summary

## Change Requested
Reorder the buttons on the crops page so that "Crop Recommendations" comes first, followed by "Seasonal Analysis".

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Tab Order (`templates/crops.html`)
**Before:**
```html
<div class="feature-tab active" onclick="showFeature('seasonal')">
    <span>📅 Seasonal Analysis</span>
</div>
<div class="feature-tab" onclick="showFeature('engine')">
    <span>🚀 Crop Recommendations</span>
</div>
```

**After:**
```html
<div class="feature-tab active" onclick="showFeature('engine')">
    <span>🚀 Crop Recommendations</span>
</div>
<div class="feature-tab" onclick="showFeature('seasonal')">
    <span>📅 Seasonal Analysis</span>
</div>
```

### 2. Updated Default Active Feature
**Before:**
- `seasonalFeature` had `class="feature-section active"`
- `engineFeature` had `class="feature-section"`

**After:**
- `seasonalFeature` has `class="feature-section"`
- `engineFeature` has `class="feature-section active"`

### 3. Updated Page Initialization
**Before:**
```javascript
// Get initial monthly analysis
getMonthlyAnalysis();
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Get initial crop recommendations (default feature)
if (currentLocation) {
    getRecommendations();
}
```

## Result
✅ **Crop Recommendations** is now the first button and loads by default
✅ **Seasonal Analysis** is now the second button
✅ Page loads with crop recommendations active instead of seasonal analysis
✅ All functionality remains intact - users can still switch between features

## User Experience Impact
- Users now see crop recommendations immediately when they visit the crops page
- The more commonly used feature (crop recommendations) is now prioritized
- Seasonal analysis is still easily accessible as the second tab
- No functionality is lost - just reordered for better UX
